             internship expenses aimed at deepening the student-athlete’s exposure to a diverse and successful career

             the sidelines, I’m getting out on the field. I hope to show the younger generation and these old heads,
             the impact you can have on future students, even though we may all choose to do it in different
             ways. I have chosen to give back and impact not only through service, but financially with a Legacy Fund
             to Ball State University, specifically targeting minority student-athletes. I aim to help bridge the gap
             between school, sports and their future - in hopes of exposing them to a world outside of sports where
             they can and will excel. Through entrepreneurship and business, anyone can tailor a life of hard
             work from sports to building an empire - <a href="#donate-please">a legacy.</a>"--Davyd Jones

        <h2>"Embrace lifelong learning and service."</h2>

            <p>Davyd, a 2012 Ball State University alumnus, and his wife, Hannah, have partnered with his alma mater in
                its mission to “engage students in education, research and creative endeavors that empower our
                graduates to have fulfilling careers and meaningful lives enriched by lifelong learning and service, while
                we enhance the economic, environmental, and social vitality of our community, our state, and our world.”
                As a former Ball State football team captain, 2018 Ball State University Athletic Hall of Fame Member and
                2020 Delaware County Athletic Hall of Fame Inductee, Davyd has embodied the mission of his alma mater
                on and off the field and continues to do so now in his professional and personal life.</p><br>
                <p>After graduating Ball State, Davyd began a career in wealth management working with families and
                business owners to manage and grow their wealth with a major focus on executive compensation, tax
                efficient income planning, qualified retirement plans and business succession planning. To compliment
                his passions around finance and the intricacies involved with making a positive impact on people’s lives,
                he developed a strong passion to give back and help the next athlete maneuver through all the possibilities
                ahead of them. This led to Davyd and his wife founding the legacy fund through Ball State, aimed at
                minority student-athletes with the hope of exposing them to a future they might not have imagined before.</p><br>
                <p>Davyd’s greatest joy is being a father to their two children, Juliana and Mylo. However, you can also find
                him back in Muncie serving on Ball State’s Black Alumni Constituent Society Board, volunteering in his
                community at The Fort Wayne Black Chamber of Commerce, Turnstone, The United Way, Voices of Unity,
                a local high school, or speaking at various events across the country. Davyd believes a major part of life
                and the happiness it gives is: God, family, and service. “I have dedicated my life to service - as I believe
                that is the true essence of life.”
